    <p>Not so long ago, if you had picked up your phone and asked it the way
    home, it would have ignored youâ€”and people would have questioned your
    sanity. But machine learning is no longer science fiction: billions of people
    use it every day. And the truth is it has actually been around for decades in
    some specialized applications, such as optical character recognition (OCR).
    The first ML application that really became mainstream, improving the
    lives of hundreds of millions of people, took over the world back in the
    1990s: the spam filter. It's not exactly a self-aware robot, but it does
    technically qualify as machine learning: it has actually learned so well that
    you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore. It was followed by
    hundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hundreds of products
    and features that you use regularly: voice prompts, automatic translation,
    image search, product recommendations, and many more.</p>
    <p>
    Where does machine learning start and where does it end? What exactly
    does it mean for a machine to learn something? If I download a copy of all
    Wikipedia articles, has my computer really learned something? Is it
    suddenly smarter? In this chapter I will start by clarifying what machine
    learning is and why you may want to use it.</p>
    <p>
    Then, before we set out to explore the machine learning continent, we will
    take a look at the map and learn about the main regions and the most
    notable landmarks: supervised versus unsupervised learning and their
    variants, online versus batch learning, instance-based versus model-based
    learning. Then we will look at the workflow of a typical ML project,
    discuss the main challenges you may face, and cover how to evaluate and
    fine-tune a machine learning system.</p>
    <p>
    This chapter introduces a lot of fundamental concepts (and jargon) that
    every data scientist should know by heart. It will be a high-level overview
    (it's the only chapter without much code), all rather simple, but my goal is
    to ensure everything is crystal clear to you before we continue on to the rest
    of the book. So grab a coffee and let's get started!</p>
