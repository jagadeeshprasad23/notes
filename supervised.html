        <h1>Supervised Machine Learning</h1>
        In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm
        includes the desired solutions, called labels (Figure 1-5). Figure 1-5.
        A labeled training set for spam classification (an example of supervised
        learning) A typical supervised learning task is classification. The spam
        filter is a good example of this: it is trained with many example emails
        along with their class (spam or ham), and it must learn how to classify
        new emails. Another typical task is to predict a target numeric value,
        such as the price of a car, given a set of features (mileage, age,
        brand, etc.). This sort of task is called regression (Figure 1-6). To
        train the system, you need to give it 1 many examples of cars, including
        both their features and their targets (i.e., their prices).
        <br />
        Note that some regression models can be used for classification as well,
        and vice versa. For example, logistic regression is commonly used for
        classification, as it can output a value that corresponds to the
        probability of belonging to a given class (e.g., 20% chance of being
        spam). Figure 1-6. A regression problem: predict a value, given an input
        feature (there are usually multiple input features, and sometimes
        multiple output values)
        <br />
        NOTE The words target and label are generally treated as synonyms in
        supervised learning, but target is more common in regression tasks and
        label is more common in classification tasks. Moreover, features are
        sometimes called predictors or attributes. These terms may refer to
        individual samples (e.g., “this car's mileage feature is equal to
        15,000”) or to all samples (e.g., “the mileage feature is strongly
        correlated with price”).
